# Determine_Climate: A React based weather app

## This is a React based climate app utilizing REST APIs.

OpenWeather API is used to pull in weather related data for a location's city name and for a US zip code. To make it easier for users to enter a location, GeoDB API is used to autocomplete a city's name. Air pollution data through a microservice is also displayed for a location entered.
