# Determine_Climate: A React based weather app

This is a React based climate app utilizing REST APIs.
OpenWeather API is used to pull in weather related data for a location. To make it easier for users to enter a location, GeoDB API is used to autocomplete a city's name.

This app was built using the Create React app skeleton.
