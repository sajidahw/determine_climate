# Determine_Climate: A React based weather app

## This is a React based climate app utilizing REST APIs.

OpenWeather API is used to pull in weather related data for a location's city name and for a US zip code. To make it easier for users to enter a location, GeoDB API is used to autocomplete a city's name. Air pollution data through a microservice is also displayed for a location entered.

## To Use the App Online:

<i>Climate app is deployed online:</i> [https://determine-climate.vercel.app/](https://determine-climate.vercel.app/)

<!-- Whereas, Google Maps API is used to display the location on a map. -->
<br>

## To Run the App Locally:

In the project directory, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the app in the development mode using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

From your terminal console, open the localhost link to view it in your browser.
